# K. Sreesh Reddy's Data Science Portfolio
This portfolio is a collection of notebooks that I prepared for experimenting with various Data Science and Machine Learning concepts along with the notebooks I submitted for competitions. Separate projects have their own category. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis:
### Stock Analysis
Stock Analysis is done on historic data so as to predict the trends which may occur in the future. Here we observe the stock prices of three companies, Tesla, Ford and GM in the 5 year range from 2012 to 2016. We also see if there is any relation between the three companies' stocks, view in the Moving Average (MA) form, observing the Daily Percentage Change and the Volatility, and Cumulative Return. Tools used are Pandas, Numpy, MatplotLib, Datareader, Scatter Matrix, Candlestick Chart, Box Plots.<br>

### Statistically Best NBA Player
With the rise of sports analytics, the desire for efficiency and data-driven judgments in recruiting new players for NBA clubs is increasing. We can now look at an extensive list of granular stats that range from the box score statistic, which assesses a player's impact to the team, to basic metrics like offensive rebounds, rather than merely eyeballing a player and judging their surface level playing stats (points, shot attempts, etc.). We may evaluate players using these measurements and determine who would be a good fit for a certain club depending on their attributes. Main Source of inspiration to pursue such a project was the movie MoneyBall.<br>

## Kaggle Competitions: 
### Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster:
Link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview <br>
This is the legendary Titanic ML competition â€“ the best, first challenge for you to dive into ML competitions and familiarize yourself with how the Kaggle platform works.

The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

Score:  0.80622<br>

### Housing Prices Competition for Kaggle Learn Users:
Link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-data-for-ml-course <br>
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

Score: 16268.60103<br>
