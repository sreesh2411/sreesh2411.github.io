# K. Sreesh Reddy's Data Science Portfolio
This portfolio is a collection of notebooks that I prepared for experimenting with various Data Science and Machine Learning concepts along with the notebooks I submitted for competitions. Separate projects have their own category. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis
### Stock Analysis
Stock Analysis is done on historic data so as to predict the trends which may occur in the future. Here we observe the stock prices of three companies, Tesla, Ford and GM in the 5 year range from 2012 to 2016. We also see if there is any relation between the three companies' stocks, view in the Moving Average (MA) form, observing the Daily Percentage Change and the Volatility, and Cumulative Return. Tools used are Pandas, Numpy, MatplotLib, Datareader, Scatter Matrix, Candlestick Chart, Box Plots.<br>

### Statistically Best NBA Player
With the rise of sports analytics, the desire for efficiency and data-driven judgments in recruiting new players for NBA clubs is increasing. We can now look at an extensive list of granular stats that range from the box score statistic, which assesses a player's impact to the team, to basic metrics like offensive rebounds, rather than merely eyeballing a player and judging their surface level playing stats (points, shot attempts, etc.). We may evaluate players using these measurements and determine who would be a good fit for a certain club depending on their attributes.<br>
